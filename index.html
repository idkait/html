	<h1 class="centertext"><u> <span style="color:mediumseagreen">Main Characters</span></U></h1> 
	<h4  class="centertext" "red bigfont"><u>Breaking Bad</u></h4>=
	<img src="Heisenberg.jpg"> 

    <p id="specialstyle"><span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold"><U>Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr.</U></span> also known by his alias Heisenberg, is a fictional character and the antihero protagonist of the American crime drama television series Breaking Bad.</p> The character is portrayed by Bryan Cranston. Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in The X-Files episode "Drive", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walt's backstory, personality, and physical appearance.  </p>
	<p>Within the series, Walt is a chemist and graduate of the California Institute of Technology, who co-founded the company Gray Matter Technologies. He left Gray Matter abruptly, selling his shares for $5,000. Soon afterward, the company made a fortune, much of it from Walt's research. Walt subsequently moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he became a high school chemistry teacher. On his 50th birthday, he is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After this discovery, Walt resorts to manufacturing and selling methamphetamines with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to ensure his family's financial security after his death. He is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade, becoming more and more ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias "Heisenberg", which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. Walt becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from "Mr. Chips into Scarface".</p>
	
	<h4 class="centertext" "red bigfont"><u>1984</u></h4>
	<img src="Winston Smith.jpg">
	<p id="specialstyle"><span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold"><U>Winston Smith</U></span> is the protagonist of 1984.He is the character that the reader most identifies with, and the reader sees the world from his point of view. </p>.<br>  Winston is a kind of innocent in a world gone wrong, and it is through him that the reader is able to understand and feel the suffering that exists in the totalitarian society of Oceania.</p>
    <p>Even Winston's name is suggestive. Winston is taken from Winston Churchill, the exalted leader of wartime England, and Smith is the most common last name in the English language, thus allowing readers to see him as Orwell intended: an ordinary man who makes a valiant effort in extraordinary circumstances. A reader cannot resist identifying with Winston: He is ordinary, yet he finds the strength to try and make his circumstances better. He represents the feelings in every human being, and it is for this reason that a reader hopes that things will change. Orwell characterizes Winston as a complete, sympathetic human being, and in doing so gives the reader a stake in the outcome of the novel. </p>
	
	
    <h4 class="centertext" "red bigfont"><u>Million Dollar Baby</u></h4>
	<img src="Maggie Fitzgerald Million Dollar Baby.jpg">
	<p id="specialstyle"><span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold"><U>Margaret "Maggie" Fitzgerald</U></span>, a waitress from the Ozarks, shows up at the Hit Pit, a rundown Los Angeles gym owned and operated by Frankie Dunn</p>.<br> Dunn is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer, revealed to be estranged by his own daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses as he does not train women and she is too old to begin a boxing career. Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee — the film's narrator — encourages and helps Maggie. Frankie's prize prospect, "Big Willie" Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. Frankie then reluctantly agrees to train Maggie.</p>
	<p>Maggie fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching. Since she has earned a reputation for quick KOs, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mickey Mack but, out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname, embroidered on her boxing robe, Mo Chuisle (misspelled in the film as "mo cuishle"), but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.</p>
